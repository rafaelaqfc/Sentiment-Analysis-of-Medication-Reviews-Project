# Sentiment Analysis of Medication Reviews

This is my project about predicting sentiment analysis of medication reviews.

Introduction

Sentiment Analysis is an Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that classifies a text document or corpusâ€™s emotional or sentimental tone, language, expression or point of view. Most of the time, emotions or attitudes can be positive, negative, somewhat positive and negative, mixed and so on. Therefore, sentiment analysis can help us to pick up and interpret the discursive patterns found in the language in order to understand and predict what are the evaluations and representations people are giving about a customer support, item bought, medication that has been taking, feedback analysis, market research, etc. In addition, classification tasks as this one can also give us clue about the audience by analyzing the demographics of the users.
